# Cliston CLI

Cliston CLI is our powerful command-line interface tool designed to accelerate development workflows in Meteor projects.

It provides a comprehensive suite of commands to scaffold new projects and generate code components, helping developers maintain consistency and follow best practices across our applications.

## Core Principles

- **Consistency**: Enforces standardized project structure and coding patterns
- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks and boilerplate code generation
- **Best Practices**: Implements proven patterns and configurations
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with our tech stack (Meteor, React, GraphQL)
