# Cliston CLI

Cliston CLI is our powerful command-line interface tool designed to accelerate development workflows in Meteor projects.

It provides a comprehensive suite of commands to scaffold new projects and generate code components, helping developers maintain consistency and follow best practices across our applications.

## Core Principles

- **Consistency**: Enforces standardized project structure and coding patterns
- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks and boilerplate code generation
- **Best Practices**: Implements proven patterns and configurations
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with our tech stack (Meteor, React, GraphQL)

## Key Features

### Project Scaffolding

Quickly bootstrap new Meteor projects using our battle-tested starter kit:

- Pre-configured Meteor + React setup
- Routing configuration with React Router
- Authentication boilerplate with role-based access
- Development tools and configurations
- Integrated i18n support
- Form handling with [Formik](https://formik.org) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- State management with [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- UI components from SupraKit UI

### Component Generation

Generate various project components on the fly:

- Forms with built-in validation and error handling
- Pages with pre-configured routing and layouts
- API endpoints with proper schema validation
- React components with styling and mobile responsiveness
- GraphQL queries and mutations setup

### API Development

Streamlined API creation and management:

- Collection schema definitions using SimpleSchema
- Validated methods with proper typing
